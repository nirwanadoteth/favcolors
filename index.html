                    Roses are red, violets are blue, and in between are a
                    million other hues. But which one of these colors is,
                    statistically speaking, the most popular around the world?
                    The perception and categorization of colors, however, does
                    seem to be fairly universal. In other words, language shapes
                    the perception of reality. But that's not what the World
                    Color Survey found. Instead, the survey found that across
                    cultures, people tended to name hues the same way. So in
                    this website, you can find the most popular color around the
                    world. Enjoy!

                <blockquote>
                    <img
                        src="assets/images/colors/blue.png"

                    />
                    There’s a good reason why most people say blue is their
                    favorite color — it’s calming, soothing, and symbolizes the
                    positive. Bright blues inspire ideas of loyalty, confidence,
                    security, and reliable authority. Many companies and brands
                    use these shades in their logos and messaging precisely
                    because of these associations.
                    <br /><br />
                    As the color of the sky and the sea, blue is also used to
                    imply a connection to nature. The turquoise shades you might
                    see in the waters of the Caribbean Sea not only calm people
                    but can also energize them. Light sky blue can make people
                    feel contemplative and serene.

                    <img
                        src="assets/images/colors/red.png"

                        class="color-img"
                    />
                    Red has meanings on two different ends of the human
                    emotional spectrum. It can symbolize passion and strength.
                    There’s a reason why everything is red on Valentine’s Day —
                    the color of love inspires people to strive for their
                    romantic goals, for example.
                    <br /><br />
                    But it’s not all hugs and kisses. Red is also a symbol of
                    wrath and danger. Angry people often say they see this
                    color, plus the Stop sign is red as well. While red can be
                    positive or negative, it’s definitely the color of action.
                    Red gets people moving, whether it’s towards the target of
                    their passion or away from a risky situation.

                        class="color-img"
                    />
                    Purple is a rare color in nature, and for the longest time,
                    purple dyes were extremely difficult and expensive to
                    produce. As a result, only the wealthiest and most powerful
                    people could afford it. To this day, we think of purple as
                    the color of royalty and luxury. Consequently, it brings up
                    a feeling of trust and reliability.
                    <br /><br />
                    Purple’s rarity also gives it an air of mystery. It’s
                    associated with creativity and the realm of fantasy — think
                    about how many times magic gets portrayed as purple in
                    popular culture. Purple can also be an inspirational color
                    that sparks the imagination and encourages us to try new
                    things.

                    Green is among the most multipurpose colors on the color
                    wheel. It’s everywhere around us — in plants, money, foods,
                    and even traffic lights. There’s a biological reason as
                    well; the human eye can see more shades of green than any
                    other color.
                    <br /><br />
                    Associated with nature and positivity, green can inspire
                    feelings of harmony, growth, safety, and success. It’s also
                    a calming color that makes people feel safe and comfortable.
                    Green is one of the most popular colors, and it’s a safe
                    choice as your design’s primary color.

                    Black is a power color that adds gravity and strength to
                    your message. Used sparingly, black can help your design
                    look polished and minimal. Black backgrounds are an
                    increasingly popular color choice in web design, but be
                    careful that it doesn’t make your interface too dark and
                    heavy.

                    White often symbolizes simplicity, purity, and cleanliness.
                    Often used to give contrast to your designs, white provides
                    a clean, neutral slate that keeps you from crowding your
                    design too much. “It’s there to give breathing room to other
                    elements and to be a background to showcase something you
                    want to bring more attention to,” says Ackerman.

                    The color of sunshine, yellow brings about positive
                    feelings. Joy, happiness, and hope are all within yellow’s
                    domain. It can boost confidence, curiosity, and even improve
                    learning. There’s just something about yellow that makes us
                    think logically and positively.
                    <br /><br />
                    At the same time, though, yellow can cause anxious and
                    uncomfortable feelings. A lot of yellow implies there’s
                    risky business happening. Think about warning signs or
                    potentially dangerous animals, like wasps. Both use yellow
                    to tell you to keep your distance. It can also signify
                    cowardice, hence the phrase “yellow-bellied.”

                    Once a color for boys, today pink is mainly associated with
                    feminine traits. Soft and pastel pinks inspire feelings of
                    kindness and compassion. Pink is a nurturing, playful, and
                    nostalgic color that takes people back to their childhoods.
                    <br /><br />
                    That said, pink is a color of opposites since it can make us
                    think of both innocence and burning passion. Bright and hot
                    pinks are associated with love, romance, and even lust.
                    Intense pinks create a sense of urgency. Because it has
                    white mixed into it, though, pink doesn’t inspire the same
                    kind of aggressive action as red.

                    A mix of red and yellow, orange combines the passion of the
                    former with the positivity of the latter. Bright and vibrant
                    oranges are fun colors that burst with youthfulness, energy,
                    and happiness. They inspire creativity and uplift people’s
                    moods. Golden oranges also exude a sense of luxury and
                    prestige.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the other hand, dark and almost brown, drab oranges —
                    like decomposing autumn leaves — can elicit feelings of
                    deceit or hopelessness. Even the energy of bright oranges
                    can create ideas of impatience. These aren’t as common as
                    the positive associations, but as a designer you should be
                    aware of them.

                    In RGB values, silver comprises R: 192, G: 192, and B: 192.
                    Silver is a metallic, shiny version of gray (hex #808080).
                    It's not a true or solid color but rather a reflective tone.
                    To achieve silver, you must apply a reflective pigment to a
                    gray base. This can either be something physical like
                    metallic paint, or an editing effect that adds a gleam to
                    your gray.
