            class="color-img" />
          There’s a good reason why most people say blue is their favorite color
          — it’s calming, soothing, and symbolizes the positive. Bright blues
          inspire ideas of loyalty, confidence, security, and reliable
          authority. Many companies and brands use these shades in their logos
          and messaging precisely because of these associations.<br /><br />As
          the color of the sky and the sea, blue is also used to imply a
          connection to nature. The turquoise shades you might see in the waters
          of the Caribbean Sea not only calm people but can also energize them.
          Light sky blue can make people feel contemplative and serene.

            alt="Red"
            class="color-img" />
          Red has meanings on two different ends of the human emotional
          spectrum. It can symbolize passion and strength. There’s a reason why
          everything is red on Valentine’s Day — the color of love inspires
          people to strive for their romantic goals, for example.<br /><br />But
          it’s not all hugs and kisses. Red is also a symbol of wrath and
          danger. Angry people often say they see this color, plus the Stop sign
          is red as well. While red can be positive or negative, it’s definitely
          the color of action. Red gets people moving, whether it’s towards the
          target of their passion or away from a risky situation.

            alt="Purple"
            class="color-img" />
          Purple is a rare color in nature, and for the longest time, purple
          dyes were extremely difficult and expensive to produce. As a result,
          only the wealthiest and most powerful people could afford it. To this
          day, we think of purple as the color of royalty and luxury.
          Consequently, it brings up a feeling of trust and reliability.<br /><br />Purple’s
          rarity also gives it an air of mystery. It’s associated with
          creativity and the realm of fantasy — think about how many times magic
          gets portrayed as purple in popular culture. Purple can also be an
          inspirational color that sparks the imagination and encourages us to
          try new things.

            alt="Green"
            class="color-img" />
          Green is among the most multipurpose colors on the color wheel. It’s
          everywhere around us — in plants, money, foods, and even traffic
          lights. There’s a biological reason as well; the human eye can see
          more shades of green than any other color.<br /><br />Associated with
          nature and positivity, green can inspire feelings of harmony, growth,
          safety, and success. It’s also a calming color that makes people feel
          safe and comfortable. Green is one of the most popular colors, and
          it’s a safe choice as your design’s primary color.

            alt="Black"
            class="color-img" />
          Black is a power color that adds gravity and strength to your message.
          Used sparingly, black can help your design look polished and minimal.
          Black backgrounds are an increasingly popular color choice in web
          design, but be careful that it doesn’t make your interface too dark
          and heavy.

            alt="White"
            class="color-img" />
          White often symbolizes simplicity, purity, and cleanliness. Often used
          to give contrast to your designs, white provides a clean, neutral
          slate that keeps you from crowding your design too much. “It’s there
          to give breathing room to other elements and to be a background to
          showcase something you want to bring more attention to,” says
          Ackerman.

            alt="Yellow"
            class="color-img" />
          The color of sunshine, yellow brings about positive feelings. Joy,
          happiness, and hope are all within yellow’s domain. It can boost
          confidence, curiosity, and even improve learning. There’s just
          something about yellow that makes us think logically and
          positively.<br /><br />At the same time, though, yellow can cause
          anxious and uncomfortable feelings. A lot of yellow implies there’s
          risky business happening. Think about warning signs or potentially
          dangerous animals, like wasps. Both use yellow to tell you to keep
          your distance. It can also signify cowardice, hence the phrase
          “yellow-bellied.”

            src="assets/images/colors/pink.png"
            alt="Pink"
            class="color-img" />
          Once a color for boys, today pink is mainly associated with feminine
          traits. Soft and pastel pinks inspire feelings of kindness and
          compassion. Pink is a nurturing, playful, and nostalgic color that
          takes people back to their childhoods.<br /><br />That said, pink is a
          color of opposites since it can make us think of both innocence and
          burning passion. Bright and hot pinks are associated with love,
          romance, and even lust. Intense pinks create a sense of urgency.
          Because it has white mixed into it, though, pink doesn’t inspire the
          same kind of aggressive action as red.

            alt="Orange"
            class="color-img" />
          A mix of red and yellow, orange combines the passion of the former
          with the positivity of the latter. Bright and vibrant oranges are fun
          colors that burst with youthfulness, energy, and happiness. They
          inspire creativity and uplift people’s moods. Golden oranges also
          exude a sense of luxury and prestige.<br /><br />On the other hand,
          dark and almost brown, drab oranges — like decomposing autumn leaves —
          can elicit feelings of deceit or hopelessness. Even the energy of
          bright oranges can create ideas of impatience. These aren’t as common
          as the positive associations, but as a designer you should be aware of
          them.

            class="color-img" />
          In RGB values, silver comprises R: 192, G: 192, and B: 192. Silver is
          a metallic, shiny version of gray (hex #808080). It's not a true or
          solid color but rather a reflective tone. To achieve silver, you must
          apply a reflective pigment to a gray base. This can either be
          something physical like metallic paint, or an editing effect that adds
          a gleam to your gray.

          Roses are red, violets are blue, and in between are a million other
          hues. But which one of these colors is, statistically speaking, the
          most popular around the world? The perception and categorization of
          colors, however, does seem to be fairly universal. In other words,
          language shapes the perception of reality. But that's not what the
          World Color Survey found. Instead, the survey found that across
          cultures, people tended to name hues the same way. So in this website,
          you can find the most popular color around the world. Enjoy!
